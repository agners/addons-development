## About

This add-on allows you to use Zigbee and OpenThread protocol simultaneous on a
single Silicon Labs based radio. The radio needs the Zigbee NCP + OpenThread RCP
firmware installed which runs a EmberZNet Zigbee firmware alongside OpenThread
RCP support. The addon has been tested with EFR32 Series 2 based radios.
